# LLM Recipe Generator

🍽️ Welcome to the LLM Recipe Generator, where you can create and generate recipes using a Large Language Model!

## Introduction

This project uses a pre-trained Language Model (LLM) to generate recipes based on user input. The model is loaded using ONNX Runtime Web, allowing for real-time recipe generation.


## Features

- **Recipe Generation:** Input the name of the recipe, and the model will generate a fully detailed recipe.

- **Dynamic Output:** The generated recipe is displayed dynamically, allowing users to see the recipe being created in real time.

## Prerequisites

- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

- Internet connection (for loading the ONNX model).

## Dataset reference :

- You can find the dataset used in this project on kaggle :

## Disclamer / ! \ :

Unfortunately this project have been made with some restricting hardware condition, so the model could not have been train enought to reach a high precision result. Therfore, I recommand you not to try to cook the recipe generated by this model (or retrain it beforehand if you have a good GPU and time).

**Happy cooking!** 🧁🍲🍰
